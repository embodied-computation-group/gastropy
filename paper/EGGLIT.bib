	abstract = {The slow wave (SW) of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract mainly functions to trigger the onset of spike to elicit smooth muscle contraction, which provides the essential power of motility. Smooth muscle myogenic control activity or SW is believed to originate in the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC). The electrical coupling promotes interaction between muscle cells, and ICC additionally contribute to SW rhythmicity. Stomach SW originates in the proximal body showing the continuous rhythmic change in the membrane potential and propagates normally to the distal antrum with a regular rhythm of approximately 3 c.p.m. A technique using electrodes positioned on the abdominal skin to pick up stomach rhythmic SW refers to electrogastrography (EGG). The stomach SW amplitude is very weak, while many visceral organs also produce rhythmic electricities, for example heartbeat, respiration, other organs of the GI tract and even body movements. Thus noise other than SW should be filtered out during the recording, while motion artifacts are visually examined and deleted. Finally, the best signal among all recordings is selected to compute EGG parameters based on spectral analysis. The latter is done not only to tranform frequency domain to time domain but also to provide information of time variability in frequency. Obtained EGG parameters include dominant frequency/power, \% normal rhythm, \% bradygastria, \% tachygastria, instability coefficient and power ratio. Clinical experience in EGG has been markedly accumulated since its rapid evolution. In contrast, lack of standardized methodology in terms of electrode positions, recording periods, test meals, analytic software and normal reference values makes the significance of EGG recording controversial. Unlike imaging or manometrical studies, stomach motility disorders are not diagnosed based only on abnormal EGG parameters. Limitations of EGG recording, processing, computation, acceptable normal parameters, technique and reading should be known to conduct subjective assessments when EGG is used to resolve stomach dysfunction. Understanding basic SW physiology, recording methodology and indications may open EGG as a new domain to approach the stomach motor dysfunction.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES 
          To determine the value of multichannel versus conventional single-channel electrogastrography (EGG) and of an additional postprandial hour recording in symptomatic patients.
          METHODS 
          Eighteen normal subjects and 47 patients with upper GI symptoms underwent multichannel EGG with four cutaneous recording electrodes placed on the antral axis. Fasting EGG was recorded for 1 h, followed by meal ingestion, followed by two 1-h postprandial EGG recordings. Variables assessed: (1) dominant frequency (DF) and its power; (2) percent time in normal (2–4) cpm frequency; (3) average percent of slow wave coupling (\% SWC).
          RESULTS 
          Normal values for single-channel EGG were: (1) DF from 2.5–3.3, 2.7–3.5, and 2.6–3.5 cpm in the fasting, first, and second postprandial hours; (2) percentage of time in 2–4 cpm: {\textgreater}50\%, {\textgreater}65\%, and {\textgreater}65\% in the fasting, first, and second postprandial hours. Normal values for percent SWC using multichannel EGG were {\textgreater}50\%, {\textgreater}55\%, {\textgreater}55\% in the fasting, first, and second postprandial hours. In the symptomatic patients, an abnormal 2-h single-channel EGG was obtained in 16 of 47 (34\%) patients. Adding an additional 1 h of postprandial recording identified another 4 abnormal patients (20/47 = 43\%). With multichannel EGG, abnormal results were obtained in 24 of 47 patients (51\%) with the 2-h study. An additional 1 h of postprandial recording identified another 4 patients as abnormal (28/47 = 60\%).
          CONCLUSIONS 
          Multichannel EGG recording improved the detection of abnormal gastric myoelectric activity in symptomatic patients. This study also demonstrates prolonging the postprandial recording to 2 h increases the diagnostic yield for both single-channel and multichannel EGG.},

	abstract = {A hard challenge for wearable systems is to measure differences in emotional valence, i.e. positive and negative affect via physiology. However, the stomach or gastric signal is an unexplored modality that could offer new affective information. We created a wearable device and software to record gastric signals, known as electrogastrography (EGG). An in-laboratory study was conducted to compare EGG with electrodermal activity (EDA) in 33 individuals viewing affective stimuli. We found that negative stimuli attenuate EGG's indicators of parasympathetic activation, or "rest and digest" activity. We compare EGG to the remaining physiological signals and describe implications for affect detection. Further, we introduce how wearable EGG may support future applications in areas as diverse as reducing nausea in virtual reality and helping treat emotion-related eating disorders.},

Since the first measurement of the EGG, a great deal of research effort has been expended on investigating its relationship with specific activities of the stomach in question. In this review, we discuss how to measure the EGG, what information is available in the EGG, how to extract useful information from the EGG and the prospective applications of the EGG. After a brief historic evolution of the EGG, we first discuss the measurement of the EGG, the importance of localisation of the stomach and the characteristics of the EGG. The most commonly used EGG data-analysis methods, both power spectral analysis and waveform analysis, are then outlined. Some of prospective applications of the EGG in clinical diagnosis and medical research are described, mainly concerning the correlation between EGG amplitude and gastric motility and that between EGG rhythmic variations and motility disorders. Specifically, we present studies on pre- and postprandial EGGs, observation of the propagation direction of the gastric slow wave and gastric electrical dysrhythmias and their correlation with gastric motility.},

In 61 normal subjects from four centers, fasting multichannel EGG was recorded for 1 h, followed by two 1-h postprandial recordings after a test meal. Variables assessed included dominant frequency (DF) and its power, percentage time in 2- to 4-cpm frequency, and percentage slow-wave coupling (\%SWC). There were no significant differences in EGG parameters with respect to gender or age. Subjects with a BMI {\textgreater}25 had a decrease in the absolute DF power but a similar increase in the postprandial DF power. Subjects with a BMI {\textgreater}25 had a postprandial decrease in the \%SWC compared to those with a BMI {\textless}25. There was a decrease in postprandial \%SWC in European/Asian centers compared to American centers. In conclusion, multichannel EGG provides assessment of electrical slow-wave coupling in addition to determining dominant frequency, power, and percentage normal rhythm. This multicenter study of normal subjects shows similar multichannel EGG values among different genders and ages. Body mass and ethnicity may impact on some of the EGG values.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have reported that various brain regions, mainly sensory, unimodal regions, display phase synchronization with the stomach's slow (0.05 Hz) myoelectrical rhythm. These gastric–brain interactions have broad implications, from feeding behavior to functional gastrointestinal disorders. However, in contrast to other interoceptive signals (e.g., heart rate) and their relation to the brain, little is known about the reliability of these gastric–brain interactions, their robustness to artifacts such as motion, and whether they can be generalized to new samples. Here we examined these aspects in 43 subjects that had undergone multiple runs of concurrent electrogastrography (EGG), brain fMRI, and pulse oximetry. We also repeated all analyses in an open dataset of a highly sampled individual. We found a set of brain regions that were coupled with the EGG signal after controlling for non-grey matter (GM) signals, head motion, and cardiac artifacts. These regions exhibited significant overlap with previous work. However, we also showed that prior to confound regression, the spatial extent of the gastric network was largely overestimated. Finally, we found substantial test–retest reliability in both the brain and the gastric signals when estimated alone, but not for measures of gastric-brain synchrony. Together, these results provide methodological scaffolding for future research into brain–stomach interactions and for a better understanding of the role of the gastric network.},

	abstract = {A network of myenteric interstitial cells of Cajal in the corpus of the stomach serves as its “pacemaker”, continuously generating a ca 0.05 Hz electrical slow wave, which is transmitted to the brain chiefly by vagal afferents. A recent study combining resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) with concurrent surface electrogastrography (EGG), with cutaneous electrodes placed on the epigastrium, found 12 brain regions with activity that was significantly phase-locked with this gastric basal electrical rhythm. Therefore, we asked whether fluctuations in brain resting state networks (RSNs), estimated using a spatial independent component analysis (ICA) approach, might be synchronized with the stomach. In the present study, in order to determine whether any RSNs are phase-locked with the gastric rhythm, an individual participant underwent 22 scanning sessions; in each, two 15-minute runs of concurrent EGG and rsfMRI data were acquired. EGG data from three sessions had weak gastric signals and were excluded; the other 19 sessions yielded a total of 9.5 hours of data. The rsfMRI data were analyzed using group ICA; RSN time courses were estimated; for each run, the phase-locking value (PLV) was computed between each RSN and the gastric signal. To assess statistical significance, PLVs from all pairs of “mismatched” data (EGG and rsfMRI data acquired on different days) were used as surrogate data to generate a null distribution for each RSN. Of a total of 18 RSNs, three were found to be significantly phase-locked with the basal gastric rhythm, namely, a cerebellar network, a dorsal somatosensory-motor network, and a default mode network. Disruptions to the gut-brain axis, which sustains interoceptive feedback between the central nervous system and the viscera, are thought to be involved in various disorders; manifestation of the infra-slow rhythm of the stomach in brain rsfMRI data could be useful for studies in clinical populations.},

	abstract = {Purpose The gut communicates with the brain, allowing the gastrointestinal state to influence cognition and emotion and vice versa. In the resting state, gastric electrical activity has been shown to be synchronized with the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal in the so-called gastric network in humans [1]. However, the finding has been rarely replicated. Here, we explored the gut-brain synchrony in rats. Whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was acquired simultaneously with electrogastrogram (EGG) recording. Cross-correlation between EGG and BOLD signals was used to map resting state networks influenced by gastric activity. Method Brain fMRI was performed on three SD rats together with multi-channel EGG recording. Each rat was trained to consume diet gel enriched with Gadolinium contrast media. Before the experiment, the rat was fed with 5g diet gel. After the feeding, the animal was anesthetized with continuous dexmedetomidine and isoflurane. The multi-channel EGG signal was recorded using an electrophysiological recording system (Tucker Davis Technologies Inc.) together with fMRI scans using a 7-tesla small-animal MRI system (BioSpec 70/30, Bruker). The principal component analysis was applied to EGG signals. The correlation between the voxel-wise fMRI signal and the component-wise EGG signal was calculated, yielding multiple gut-associated brain networks. The voxel-wise fMRI signal was also modeled as a linear combination of EGG component time series with varying time shifts. Results FMRI was acquired simultaneously with the EGG recording ( Fig. 1A). EGG was denoised and cross-correlated with the BOLD activity in every voxel to map an EGG-correlated network (or the gastric network) ( Fig. 1C). The BOLD signal was averaged across voxels in the gastric network. The resulting network-wide signal was found to be phase-locked to EGG with a time delay ( Fig. 1B). Accounting for the delay variable across voxels, we mapped an even broader network phase-locked with EGG ( Fig. 2A). Different EGG-coupled regions were found to lag behind EGG by different times, ranging from 4 to 12 seconds ( Fig. 2B \& C). From the EGG-coupled BOLD response, the visual and auditory cortex had a relatively longer delay, whereas the somatosensory and anterior cingulate cortex had a shorter delay. The cingulate cortex showed a complex response pattern, likely implying multiple functional roles with respect to the gut. Conclusion In rats, brain activity is intrinsically synchronized with gastric activity at a specific resting state network. In this network, different brain regions are time-locked to gastric activity with varying time delays. Speculatively, the pattern of time delay may reflect how gastric information propagates through a cascade of brain regions for sequential processing.

	abstract = {Electrogastrography (EGG) is the noninvasive electrophysiological technique used to record gastric electrical activity by means of cutaneous electrodes placed on the abdomen. EGG has been so far mostly used in clinical studies in gastroenterology, but it represents an attractive method to study brain-viscera interactions in psychophysiology. Compared to the literature on electrocardiography for instance, where practical recommendations and normative data are abundant, the literature on EGG in humans remains scarce. The aim of this article is threefold. First, we review the existing literature on the physiological basis of the EGG, pathways of brain-stomach interactions, and experimental findings in the cognitive neuroscience and psychophysiology literature. We then describe practical issues faced when recording the EGG in young healthy participants, from data acquisition to data analysis, and propose a semi-automated analysis pipeline together with associated MATLAB code. The analysis pipeline aims at identifying a regular rhythm that can be safely attributed to the stomach, through multiple steps. Finally, we apply these recording and analysis procedures in a large sample (N = 117) of healthy young adult male and female participants in a moderate ({\textless}5 hr) to prolonged ({\textgreater}10 hr) fasting state to establish the normative distribution of several EGG parameters. Our results are overall congruent with the clinical gastroenterology literature, but suggest using an electrode coverage extending to lower abdominal locations than current clinical guidelines.

	abstract = {Sound decision making relies on emotional markers created in the body when deliberating action; according to the Somatic Marker hypothesis, this process is compromised under strong and incongruous emotional states. At the same time, "gut feelings" are rooted in neuroanatomical evidence of gut-brain crosstalk. I hypothesize we could measure "gut" biosignals to help individuals regulate emotions and enhance decision-making. However, this work has not been explored in human-computer interaction (HCI). In this thesis I motivate, define and design gut-brain computer interfacing (GBCI). I define GBCIs to be interfaces that measure gut-brain activity and establish communication between the gut-brain and an external device. This thesis investigates GBCI as a closed-loop biofeedback interface for enhancing higher order cognitive functions. In specific, a GBCI for emotion regulation.},

	abstract = {Resting-state networks offer a unique window into the brain’s functional architecture, but their characterization remains limited to instantaneous connectivity thus far. Here, we describe a novel resting-state network based on the delayed connectivity between the brain and the slow electrical rhythm (0.05 Hz) generated in the stomach. The gastric network cuts across classical resting-state networks with partial overlap with autonomic regulation areas. This network is composed of regions with convergent functional properties involved in mapping bodily space through touch, action or vision, as well as mapping external space in bodily coordinates. The network is characterized by a precise temporal sequence of activations within a gastric cycle, beginning with somato-motor cortices and ending with the extrastriate body area and dorsal precuneus. Our results demonstrate that canonical resting-state networks based on instantaneous connectivity represent only one of the possible partitions of the brain into coherent networks based on temporal dynamics.},

	abstract = {Visceral rhythms orchestrate the physiological states underlying human emotion. Chronic aberrations in these brain–body interactions are implicated in a broad spectrum of mental health disorders. However, the relationship between gastric–brain coupling and affective symptoms remains poorly understood. Here we investigated the relationship between this novel interoceptive axis and mental health in 243 participants, using a cross-validated machine learning approach. We find that increased frontoparietal brain coupling to the gastric rhythm indexes a dimensional signature of poorer mental health, spanning anxiety, depression, stress and well-being. Control analyses confirm the specificity of these interactions to the gastric–brain axis. Our study proposes coupling between the stomach and brain as a factor in mental health and offers potential new targets for interventions remediating aberrant brain–body coupling.},
